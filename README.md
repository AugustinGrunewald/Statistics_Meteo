Study of a meteo dataset : https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/donnees-synop-essentielles-omm/exports/csv?lang=fr&qv1=(date%3A%5B2015-08-03T22%3A00%3A00Z%20TO%202025-09-03T21%3A59%3A59Z%5D)&timezone=Europe%2FBerlin&use_labels=true&delimiter=%3B

PLEASE CREATE A FOLDER AT THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF YOUR PROJECT data/ CONTAINING THE CSV FILE

Working on a Notebook, that must at least contain:
- A presentation of the data with numerical and graphical summaries of the data (several, of course).
- A calculation and study of an estimator.
- Statistical tests (at least one on a parameter and one ANOVA).
- A regression and correlation study.
- A PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and a PLS (Partial Least Squares).
- A clustering method.

And for each method used and illustrated, the following questions must be answered:
- What question am I asking about the data? What do I want to illustrate?
- Why is the method I am going to use relevant?
- What conclusions do I draw from it?
- What are the possible limitations of what I am proposing?
